# Auto API UI

Visually create an API via a user interface.

## Overview

App provides a UI that generates a config file that builds an express API. App also automatically generates documentation for the API.

The inspiration for this comes from the Vue-CLI UI, that lets you bootstrap Vue projects from a user interface.

## Requirements

* Users can generate API endpoints
* Users can access params from URL
* Users can return data from endpoints
* Users can choose database
* Users can run the app from the UI
* Users can update endpoints and options after generating
* Generate config file and documentation for API
